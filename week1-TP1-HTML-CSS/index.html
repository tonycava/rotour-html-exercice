        <p id="TextFirstBlockLeft">James A. Doonan (November 8, 1841 - April 12, 1911) was an American Catholic priest
            and Jesuit who was the president of Georgetown University from 1882 to 1888. Born in Georgia, he studied at
            Georgetown before entering the Society of Jesus in 1857. During his formation, he taught at Loyola College
            in Maryland and Boston College. He also studied at Woodstock College and was ordained a priest in 1874.
            Doonan became a professor at Georgetown before being named president in 1882. He worked to offset the debt
            accrued during the construction of Healy Hall, and installed in front of the building two historic cannons
            that had been carried aboard Lord Baltimore's 1634 expeditionary voyage to Maryland. He also oversaw
            construction of a new building for the School of Medicine. After his presidency, Doonan continued teaching
            and engaging in pastoral work throughout the Northeastern United States. He died at Georgetown in 1911.
